What is PokeApp?

An entertaining and easily accessible web app that asks users information about their enemies (personality traits, general physicality, etc.) and then presents them with the Pokémon best suited to defeat that enemy in a fight. The app also provides the user with a map that indicates the best battleground locations on which to annihilate their enemy. 

What is the mission of PokeApp?

To provide easily accessible Pokémon-related entertainment. Pokémon is a franchise with many TV series, video games, and mobile applications, but there is a need for quick, free ways for Pokémon fans to engage with their friends and favorite characters. PokeApp  fulfills this need by being a product that doesn't require any set-up on the part of the users, but can still provide them with an informative and humorous experience.
